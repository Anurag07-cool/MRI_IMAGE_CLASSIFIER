## Tumor Types Classified

1. **Glioma** - Tumors that occur in the brain and spinal cord
2. **Meningioma** - Tumors forming on brain and spinal cord membranes
3. **Pituitary Tumor** - Tumors in the pituitary gland
4. **No Tumor** - Healthy brain scans

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Flask

### Setup
1. Clone or download the project files
